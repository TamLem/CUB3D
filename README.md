# CUB3D
## Raycasting (3D graphics in C)

In collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/jroth42/">jroth</a>

This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which youâ€™ll have to find your way.

The project uses a small graphics library <a href="https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42">MLX42</a> to render the graphics, which inturn uses <a href="https://github.com/glfw/glfw">GLFW</a>. 

Camera rotation and movement is also created.The camera can moved using keys W, A, S, and D, for rotation LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys are used.
